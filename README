-- C++ Based NoSQL Database --
A locally stored NoSQL database made with C++. Behaviour of database resembles Firebase Firestore.

The database can throw errors if given incorrectly formatted commands! This is intentional! I purposefully left some niche cases unresolved because I am planning to use this project in a future repository to demonstrate proficiency with automated test cases. If commands are entered properly, the database will always work.

Build instructions:

IMPORTANT!
Must have a folder named 'database' in the root directory! This is where the information will be stored.

Requires a C++ compiler, instructions given for g++

From the root directory, 
Run: g++ -o output_name probability_test.cpp

To run the built program, 
Run: ./output_name.exe
